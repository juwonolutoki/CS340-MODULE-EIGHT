# CS340-MODULE-SEVEN-
Galzioso project submission
# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
I broke down the code into modular components, functions, and classes that serve specific purposes. For the CRUD module, I had separate functions or classes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records in the database. I also did a lot of testing by writing unit tests for my CRUD operations to ensure they worked as intended. This not only helps catch bugs early but also made it easier for me to adapt the code in the future without introducing new errors.
# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
I engaged with Grazioso Salvare to thoroughly understand their needs and expectations. This included gathering detailed specifications about the types of data to be stored, how it would be accessed, and the desired functionality of the dashboard. Also, developing user stories helped frame the requirements from an end-user perspective, ensuring that the solution was user-friendly and aligned with client goals. Creating the user stories gave me a clear understanding of the client's requirements which I used to create an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visualize the database structure, defining entities, relationships, and attributes. 
# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Identify and analyze complex problems, breaking them down into manageable components. This involves understanding user requirements and finding the most effective solutions. I design and build software applications, ensuring they meet user needs while being efficient, scalable, and maintainable. I also develop databases and data architectures to store, retrieve, and manipulate data efficiently. This includes ensuring data integrity, security, and accessibility.
